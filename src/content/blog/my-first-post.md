<!-- I will describe you my whole process to create a Website using Astro Framework. You can get the all the Astro documentation from this [Link](https://astro.build/) and if you are interested on this template you can get it from the author [github](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)

## Table of Contents

## What we use?

I had to leern about several different tools to understand how to make this website, you will find a short description about it and also a link so you can easily go to the oficial site or the documentation I used.

| Tool               | Description                                                                                 | Where to find |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------|
| **_CMD_**          | I use the windows terminal to easily install packages and work with directories. Love to have it personalized so you will find the link to Oh my zShell to pimp it as you want          | [ohMyZshell](https://ohmyz.sh/) |
| **_VSCode_**  | Reading and understanding code must be easy and pretty, take a look at Microsoft VS code, it offer a lot of personalization and add ons.             |  [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)|
| **_Git_**  | To keep track of all the changes and different versions through the whole process.                                                      | What is [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)|
| **_gitHub_**  | I needed a way to share the repository and also to be able to upload it to the site, you get the idea. | [github](https://github.com/) |
| **_YouTube_**       | Yup! And a lot, you have no idea how much you can learn once you stop watching funny dogs videos on it .                                                                         | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)|
| **_Notion_**     | Thi is the best way to keep your notes, I normally forget my ideas after I say them but with Notion I can go back to my ideas at any time and take advantage of it.                                         | [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)|
| **_Astro_**     | The top web Framework to create Content-Driven Websites, it has many templates and personaliztion options, read the documentation                           | [AstroDocs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)|
| **_cloudfare_**        | This site must be allocated somehere                                                               | [CloudFare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login)|

## In the Beginning...

I had an idea! It actually begun with me facing a problem (typical), I am good with data but I have no way of showing how good I am because the Data I handle Must not be shared. I needed a place I can Call mine and where I can display all the things I know how to use with data that will not compromise anything.

So I created "Roger's Place" thi is going to work as my project Portfolio and will continue creating post on my free time to keep learning and sharing with you!

## First Things First!

Since I am no Web Developer, I started reading about Astro, with the scarce knowledge I had about HTML and CSS and with the help of Platzi courses I was able to find a path to follow and it was easier when a friend decided to be by my side when I got stuck. Astro gives you the option to create your own site from scratch with the base template but if you are a noob on Web Developing like me, you can use a template and make the necessary adjusment to it, that is exactly what I did here, is easier and for the purposes I have in mind, it Works!

This is my third attempt at uploading this site, it was not easy, but it was interesting to understand how many issues arrise while trying something new. I learn the hard way about packages dependencies and also how ugly the default Windows terminal is.

## No guide!

I never said this was a guide is just
 -->

I stumbled onto this whole world of web development and felt like a fish out of water. I mean, **HTML and CSS** were not exactly my forte, and here I was trying to create a digital space for myself. So, the first thing I did was hit up Google and find some resources.

**Me:** Alright, so HTML and CSS… where do I even start?

**Google:** Enter [Astro Framework](https://astro.build/).

## Tools of the Trade

I dove into the deep end, learning about different tools along the way. Here’s a snapshot of the journey:

| Tool           | Description                                                                                                              | Where to find                                                                |

| **VSCode**     | For reading and understanding code, it had to be Microsoft’s VS Code. The customization options are a coder’s dream.     | [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)                             |
| **Git**        | Git for version control, because tracking changes is crucial.                                                            | What is [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) |
| **GitHub**     | GitHub was my go-to for sharing and uploading my repository.                                                             | [github](https://github.com/)                                                |
| **YouTube**    | A surprising teacher. Goodbye funny dog videos, hello tutorials.                                                         | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)                                          |

## The Birth of “Roger’s Place”

**Me:** So, why “Roger’s Place”? Well, I had this problem—good with data but nowhere to showcase it. Privacy matters, you know?

**Brain:** Enter the concept of a digital portfolio. Lightbulb!

**Me:** “Roger’s Place” it is! A space to flaunt my data skills without compromising a thing.

## The Astro Learning Curve

**Me:** Now, let’s talk about Astro. I’m no web dev expert, so starting from scratch seemed like a daunting task. Astro made life easier by offering templates. Adjusting a template to fit my needs? Bingo!

**Friend:** Ah yes, the template lifeline. Always a savior.

## Trial, Error, and Template Tango

**Me:** So, let me tell you about my dance with templates. The first attempt? Oh boy, it was a disaster. I got trigger-happy and duplicated the repository at the root. Chaos ensued.

**Friend:** Duplicate frenzy? Classic move. Been there, done that.

**Me:** Attempt number two? Well, I decided to play with Tailwind settings without consulting the sacred scrolls (aka documentation). Bad move. Everything looked like a neon disco party.

**Windows Terminal:** still looking ugly, now with neon lights

## The Third Time's the Charm

**Me:** But hey, third time's a charm, right? I finally managed to clone the repository without creating a digital mess. Dependencies were set straight, and I learned the importance of reading before tinkering.

**Astro:** nodding in approval

## The Update Odyssey

**Me:** Now, updating dependencies. Ah, the Odyssey of every developer. I spent quality time ensuring everything was up to date before deploying. No one wants outdated packages crashing the party.

**Reader:** Smart move. Updates are the unsung heroes.

## The Final Countdown

**Me:** With the dependencies sorted, it was time to run the tests. Everything checked out, and the upload to Cloudflare was surprisingly smooth.

**Cloudflare:** welcoming the site with open arms

**Me:** So, here we are, ready to post and share. No more messing around, just pure content creation from now on.

**Reader:** Cheers to that! What's next on "Roger's Place"?

## Post, Post, and More Posts

**Me:** Ah, the beauty of a fresh site ready for a content onslaught. I'm geared up to post as much as possible, sharing my journey, my learnings, and maybe a bit of the chaos in between.

**Astro:** standing by, ready for action

**Me:** This isn't just a portfolio; it's a living, breathing space where ideas and experiences will find a home, I am just planning to let my brain flow here.

## The Never-ending Conversation

**Me:** So, my friend, that's the story so far. A journey of trial, error, and a touch of neon chaos. Now, it's all about the posts.
