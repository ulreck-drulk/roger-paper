# The Challenge-Driven Business Administrator

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Roger, a business administrator fueled by a passion for overcoming challenges. With over 6 years of diving deep into the world of data, I thrive on finding solutions that others might find daunting.

## Why I'm Different:

- **Data Detective:** Excel, SQL, SAP, Exactus, Salesforce â€” I've navigated these realms like a pro. I'm not just familiar with them; I excel in utilizing them to unravel complexities and streamline operations.

- **No Official Training, All Hands-On Expertise:** While my journey may not boast official training, I'm proud to be a hands-on learner, navigating the world of technology and design with curiosity and determination. Unlike a seasoned pro, I'm still finding my way around tools like Astro, Tailwind, CSS, and HTML. But don't let that fool you â€“ my proficiency shines when it comes to wrangling data with SQL and mastering the art of Excel. I believe in learning by doing, and my journey is a testament to the power of curiosity and hands-on exploration. I mean, look! I created this site! :)

## My Mantra: "I am the Main Character"

In every challenge, I don't just see a problem; I see an opportunity to innovate. Embracing the mantra "I am the Main Character," my attitude propels me to dive into complexities headfirst and emerge with efficient, effective answers. Because in the story of problem-solving, I am the protagonist determined to find solutions that make a difference.

## Beyond Work:

When I'm not immersed in data-driven solutions, you'll find me on a journey to become a Data Scientist and mastering technologies to evolve into a Full Stack developer. Additionally, I'm diving into the exciting world of live streaming on Twitch using OBS. And for those moments when I just want to kick back and relax, you might catch me enjoying a few rounds of video games. Because even the most dedicated problem-solver needs time to unwind, recharge, and embark on new learning adventures!

Ready to conquer challenges together? Let's make it happen!
